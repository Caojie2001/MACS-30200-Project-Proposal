# MACS-30200-Project-Proposal: From Revolution to Representation
## Description
The project aims to investigate the evolution of the portrayal of women in Chinese state-owned newspapers since 1949, focusing on how it has responded to ideological shifts within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) regarding gender equality. Different from developed Western countries, the development of feminism and gender equality careers is embedded into overall political reform narratives before and after the establishment of the PRC in 1949. Although a large number of studies have shown that in recent years, with the progress of modernization, there has been a certain tendency for gender discrimination to recede in China and around the world, there is still a controversy in the academic community about the impact of the CCP's political propaganda on gender discrimination in China after 1949. This project applies computational content analysis methods to state-owned media newspapers to examine the evolution pattern of gender portrayal on different dimensions of gender stereotype.
